            <h3>The Measure Of A Man</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>So you are probably asking yourself how can some cook build such sophisticated robot that can cook like
                some of the best chefs in world? Well you not the only one! Since I was a little kid I always wanted to
                create my robot that can learn like ordinary human, watching and listening.
                <br><br>
                After 20 years of cooking and making some extraordinary dishes I have decided to pass on my knowledge
                to a robot because the robot will live forever so there is no risk of losing such precious knowledge on
                making some amazing food :)
                <br><br>
                The robot is composed of 24.6 kilograms of tripolymer composites, 11.8 kilograms of molybdenum-cobalt
                alloys
                and 1.3 kilograms of bioplast sheeting.

                It was built with an ultimate storage capacity of eight hundred quadrillion Bits (approximately 100,000
                terabytes) and a
                total linear computational speed rated at sixty trillion operations per second.
                <br><br>
                However, I later augmented his computational speed by converting his interlink sequencer to an
                asynchronous mode of operation, removing the performance constraint created by virtue of having space
                between his positronic links.
                <br><br>
                I could go an on but you wouldn't understand a thing, all I can say is this: It just works!
