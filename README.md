UI repo for the Chef Portfolio build week project

This is my first readme so lets go :)

Fully responsive across all devices(desktop, tablet, phone), used less for compiling the css and js. Used
js for sticky navigation, smooth scroll and using vanilla js to build my first API.

Successfully implemented service worker and now you can access the content even offline

pages:

1.  index
2.  about
3.  contact
4.  news

5.  On index/home page for the main navigation I wrote JS code for sticky nav, for the styling I used radial gradient and experimented with colors. Beside that I wrote 3d animation for the navigation links when you hover they go 360 deg.

On the main photo of chef I made 2 buttons using less
mixins and also used mixins throughout the project.
Buttons change color on hover.

For the main heading I used more css animations, for the glowing/shining effect.

The main idea for this portfolio is about master chef who is top cook but also very much interested in robotics so he created his own robot that will do the cooking and cleaning. So he is basically a genius.

At the botoom of index/home page there are testimonials of some happy customers.

2. On about page I wrote an article about the robot.
   Then I put photos again used with css animation for nice effects on hover.

3. Contact page: standard contact me page but I used css styles extensively, very responsive.

4. On news page I have implement API that fetches world news. I am aware that is was not required
   is a complete stretch but I am interested in them. I used asynchronous function to fetch news from API.
   So I took json and there is array article and used for each to create component from it.
